<div class="classBorder">
<span class="sectionTitle">Documentation:</span> Subclass heirarchy to represent all tremolo-equipped guitars. The "bridge_type" slot of this class heirarchy is overwritten here to exclude "fixed" to reflect this. 

The hierarchy is broken up by locking tremolo systems and non-locking tremolo systems. A locking tremolo system is one that includes bolts at the nut of a guitar's neck to prevent the strings from sliding while using the tremolo. A non-locking tremolo system does not include these bolts.<br><br>

Symbols:
- Single: A single cut guitar only has one carved horn, such as a Telecaster or Les Paul shape.
- Double: A double cut guitar has two horns, such as a Stratocaster.
- Explorer: The guitar is a X shape, like a Gibson Explorer.</td>

Definition: The body of a guitar is the portion attached to the neck housing the bridge and pickups. The wood it is made of is greatly varied based on the manufacturer, so it is input as a string.</td>

<td class="mozillaTableHack">Slot that represents the bridge mounted to an electric guitar with symbols. The bridge is the piece of metal that meets the strings of a guitar at its body.

Symbols:
- Fixed: A non-moving bridge. This provides greater guitar tuning stability, but is not equipped with tremolo.
- Standard floating: A whammy bar mounted to a bridge with springs floating it in a cavity in the back of the guitar. This is easy to use and provides tremolo, but sacrifices guitar tuning stability.
- Bigsby: The first type of non-locking tremolo bridge that presses the bar to the strings rather than moving the bridge itself.
- Floyd Rose: A locking variant of the standard floating bridge that includes bolts at the nut of a guitar (place where the strings meet the guitar's neck) . This provides greater tuning stability, but makes a guitar harder to restring.
- Ibanez Edge: A series of modified Floyd Rose bridges that utilize an innovative knife edge design to increase tuning stability.</td>

<td class="mozillaTableHack"><a href="slot_pickup_configuration.html">pickup_configuration</a></td>
<td class="mozillaTableHack">Slot representing the pickup configuration of an electric guitar with one of seven symbols.

Definition: A pickup is a magnetic coil mounted to the body of an electric guitar. These coils are sensitive to changes in frequency of the guitar string, and cause electrical changes in the signal chain to produce the sound of an electric guitar. They are mounted near the bridge, neck, or halfway in between (middle).

Definition: A single coil pickup a single line of magnetic coil under a string. It produces a brighter sound, but causes noise hum when it isn't played.

Definition: A humbucker pickup is two single coil pickups wired out of phase. It produces a more powerful sound and "bucks" (or cancels) the hum normally experienced by single coil pickups. It has stronger harmonic response.

Definition: A P90 is a classic single coil pickup designed by Gibson. P90s are less crisp than traditional single coils with extended midrange. These pickups coined the term "soapbar pickups".

Symbols:
- S: The guitar has one single coil pickup. 
- H: The guitar has one bridge humbucker.
- SS: The guitar has bridge and neck single coil pickups.
- HH: The guitar has a bridge and neck humbucker.
- SSS: The guitar has bridge, middle, and neck single coil pickups.
- HSS: The guitar has a bridge humbucker and middle and neck single coil pickups.
- HSH: The guitar has bridge and neck humbuckers and a middle single coil pickup.
- HHH: The guitar has bridge, middle, and neck humbucker pickups.
- P90s: The guitar has classic P90 pickus.
- Active: The guitar has humbuckers hooked into an active circuit. These are powered by a battery to produce even more gain on the guitar's sound and used by metal players.</td>

Definition: The scale length of an electric guitar is the maximum vibrating range of a string across its neck. Guitars with longer scale length are easier to play faster, but guitars with shorter scale length are easier to pitch-bend strings on.</td>
