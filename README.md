Undergraduate programming projects

Latest Revision: June 6th, 2016

Introduction:
Welcome to my coding portfolio! These directories contain almost every large programming 
project I've worked on as a Clemson student, plus some extra lab reports and documentation.

Unless otherwise specified, directories containing code can be built into 
executables with the makefile command "make".

There are not explicit readme.txt files for each project, but each file of code is verbosely commented to explain
exactly what is happening to compensate. Programs with runtime flags have been modified to show those flags on
execution to make the user aware of them. 

Please feel free to contact me at rcbarke@g.clemson.edu if you have any questions about or are interested 
in one of the projects here.

Enjoy!

Some directories are subdivided by Clemson's course indexing system (ECExxx). An index to decode these is below.
Note this is not a full list of courses I took at Clemson. That can be found at the link below:

Relevant Course Indices:
- ECE209: Logic and Computing Devices Laboratory
- ECE222: Systems Programming Concepts
- ECE223: Computer Systems Engineering
- ECE311: Electrical Engineering Laboratory III
- ECE322: Operating Systems
- ECE327: Digital Computer Design
- ECE371: Microcontroller Interfacing
- ECE440: Performance Analysis of Local Computer Networks
- ECE442: Knowledge Engineering and Artificial Intelligence
- ECE495: Integrated Systems Design I 
- ECE496: Integrated Systems Design II

Ownership Disclaimers: 

1. Each project in ECE223 was given with some of the code partially written. This includes any file named labX.c, 
all of the makefiles, and a heap API used in the Dijsktra's algorithm project (heap.c and heap.h). Additionally, 
any unit drivers inside of labX.c files were written by myself, but equilibrium drivers were written by 
the instructor. The author for all remaining code from this class is exclusively me. I have also modified small
aspects of each project, especially the Dijkstra's Algorithm project, to make them more friendly to outside users.

2. The Networked Battleship Game for ECE440 was a group project. My group decided to split portions of the software to 
different team members, since the design was modular. I am the exclusively author of and was mainly responsible for
host.c and the makefile. Other team members on this project included:
- Nathan Pocta (npocta@g.clemson.edu)
- Chandler Coffman (cgcoffm@g.clemson.edu)
- Tyler Johnston (tgjohns@g.clemson.edu)
- Jacob Goff (jtgoff@g.clemson.edu)

3. All other code in these directories was written by myself exclusively.
